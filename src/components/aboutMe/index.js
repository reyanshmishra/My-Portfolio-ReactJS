        Hey, My name is Reyansh Mishra, I am an Android and fullstack deverloper. In my college days, I created an Android App
        called Boom because of which got my firt offer from a startup.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        When I was in final year of my graduation I had PPO from L&T Infotech and Infosys but I chose to work with a Startup
        because learning new skills and development work excites me more than working in an MNC. I am an Android and
        ReactJS/Native enthusiast and have created a couple of open source projects on my GitHub profile.
        <br />
        <br />
        I started learning android when I had to create a project for my graduation and I learned android development from youtube
        and with the help of some blogs and open source projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        In my spare time, I either play a video game on my PlayStation 4 or use the internet or read technical blogs. I donâ€™t like
        to study books so I use Quora to gain a little bit of knowledge, sometimes I answer some questions as well.

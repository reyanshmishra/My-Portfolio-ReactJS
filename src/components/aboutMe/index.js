        Hello, My name is Reyansh Mishra, I am an Android and Full-stack developer. In my college days, I created an Android App
        called Boom because of which I got my first job offer from a startup.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        When I was in the final year of my graduation I had PPO's from L&T Infotech and Infosys but I chose to work with a Startup
        because learning new skills and development work excites me more than working in an MNC. I am an Android and
        ReactJS/Native enthusiast and have created a couple of open source projects on my GitHub profile as well. Please feel free
        to my{' '}

          GitHub
        </a>{' '}
        profile.
        <br />
        <br />
        I started learning android when I had to create a project for my final semester of graduation and I learned android
        development from youtube and with the help of some blogs and open source projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        In my spare time, I like play video games, use the internet or read technical blogs. I donâ€™t like to read a so I use{' '}

        to gain a little bit of knowledge, sometimes I write answers as well.
